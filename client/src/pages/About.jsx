        Mazda can be summed up in a single word: bold. Not only do its cars
        generally look like nothing else on the market, but it’s also invested
        heavily in innovative engine technology. So, while many car makers have
        moved to smaller turbocharged engines, Mazda instead offers larger
        motors that are still efficient. For example, the entry-level petrol
        option in the Mazda 3 is a 2.0-litre unit – far larger than what you’ll
        find in most rivals – but it remains very clean. Highlights of Mazda’s
        line-up include the MX-5 sports car, which has won our Convertible of
        the Year Award multiple times, and the CX-5 large SUV, which was named
        as our inaugural best car for dog owners.
